A builder is looking to build a row of `N` houses that can be of `K` different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an `N` by `K` matrix where the `n`-th row and `k`-th column represents the cost to build the `n`-th house with `k`-th color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
